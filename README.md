This is an example of Tax loss harvesting (TLH). TLH is an investment strategy for "generating" capital losses to gain a tax advantage. 
It occurs when an investor sells a security that has depreciated in value only for the tax losses. This demo is just to showcase how to pythonize this process and calculations with some visualization.
